            <strong>Algonquin Provincial Park</strong> is a provincial park
            located between Georgian Bay and the Ottawa River in Ontario,
            Canada, mostly within the Unorganized South Part of Nipissing
            District. Established in 1893, it is the oldest provincial park in
            Canada.[1] Additions since its creation have increased the park to
            its current size of about 7,653 square kilometres (2,955 sq mi). The
            park is contiguous with several smaller, administratively separate
            provincial parks that protect important rivers in the area,
            resulting in a larger total protected area.[2]

            Its size, combined with its proximity to the major urban centres of
            Toronto and Ottawa, makes Algonquin one of the most popular
            provincial parks in the province and the country. Highway 60 runs
            through the south end of the park, while the Trans-Canada Highway
            bypasses it to the north. Over 2,400 lakes and 1,200 kilometres of
            streams and rivers are located within the park. Some notable
            examples include Canoe Lake and the Petawawa, Nipissing, Amable du
            Fond, Madawaska, and Tim rivers. These were formed by the retreat of
            the glaciers during the last ice age.
